## 1. Introduction
  Since the medical systems and the people’s acknowledgement of the health have been improved,
average life expectancy has been increasing over time world-wide. The European Commission
predicts that there will be a growth of 57.6% of life expectancy in 2061 while in 2013 there
was a growth rate of 36% of life expectancy (Antonio et al., 2017). This is also backed up by
the statistics of the World Bank. 73.4 the life expectancy in 1960 increased to 81.8 by 2018
in the Netherlands (The World Bank, 2018). Since actuarial products are strongly dependent
on people’s life or death, projecting future mortality rate is one of the most important topics
among the actuaries. In the case of life insurances, for example, premiums, death benefits, and
all the costs are calculated based on the mortality rates of the insured. Miscalculation of these
values causes unexpected costs to the insurer. This is called the longevity risk and there are few
steps to handle it. The first step is to obtain as precise predictions of future mortality rates as
possible. This helps to quantify the longevity risk, which decreases the probability of making
wrong calculations.
However, dealing with the uncertainties in the future is volatile while there is always room
for un-expectancy. In this sense, small changes in factors such as the form of data set or the
application of the model could bring totally different predictions. One of well-known factors is
whether the model takes into account the causes of deaths to the projections (Alai et al., 2015).
This is because future trends of the mortality rate rely on the trend of the causes of deaths.
For instance, heart disease, cancers are the two main causes of total deaths. Although deaths
caused by heart diseases are the largest, the mortality rate of cancer deaths would become a
major factor in the future. Based on the data of the National Cancer Institute, the number of
deaths by cancers was around 6 million in 1990 and became about 10 million in 2017, meaning
cancer deaths have increased by almost 66% or more over about 30 years (Roser and Ritchie, 2015). Likewise, in the future, there are always the possibility that a new cause of deaths be-comes the main cause of deaths. Also, on the other hand, one cause of deaths suddenly would become perfectly curable. This paper will answer the question how eliminating a single cause of deaths affects the projection of mortality rates. This paper particularly reviews all cancer deaths as mentioned previously. The estimation is made with the help of Lee and Carter model and the projection will be following. The projection result will explain the impact of the one cause of deaths to the future mortality rates. Finally, the conclusion is based on the differences on the life expectancy, which is a general way to interpret the result of predicted mortality rates.
