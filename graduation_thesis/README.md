# The impact of cause-specific mortality forecasting on projections of life

expectancy
## Overview
  Since the medical systems and the people’s acknowledgement of the health have been improved,
average life expectancy has been increasing over time world-wide. Since actuarial products are strongly dependent
on people’s life or death, projecting future mortality rate is one of the most important topics
among the actuaries. In the case of life insurances, for example, premiums, death benefits, and
all the costs are calculated based on the mortality rates of the insured. Miscalculation of these
values causes unexpected costs to the insurer. This is called the longevity risk and there are few
steps to handle it. The first step is to obtain as precise predictions of future mortality rates as
possible. This helps to quantify the longevity risk, which decreases the probability of making
wrong calculations.
However, dealing with the uncertainties in the future is volatile while there is always room
for un-expectancy. In this sense, small changes in factors such as the form of data set or the
application of the model could bring totally different predictions. One of well-known factors is
whether the model takes into account the causes of deaths to the projections (Alai et al., 2015).
This is because future trends of the mortality rate rely on the trend of the causes of deaths.
Finally, the projection of mortality rate is strongly affected by eliminating
causes of deaths. Hence, when the projection of mortality rate is based on COD, the selection
of the COD might be one of most important factors to be consider.
